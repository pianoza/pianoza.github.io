  - title: Transductive transfer learning for domain adaptation in brain magnetic resonance image segmentation
    description: Proposed histogram loss to minimise the differences in the activation maps of a 2.5D CNN. Images from target domain are used in training but without ground truth masks. Results showed improvements for two different brain MRI segmentation tasks.

  - title: Improving the detection of autism spectrum disorder by combining structural and functional MRI information
    description: Proposed to combine structural and functional MRI features to classify autism spectrum disorder. Structural features were extracted from FreeSurfer brain image parcellation masks on T1-w  MRI images. And the functional features were extracted using by constructing connectivity matrices and further dimensionality reduction using the Fisher score. The classification performance achieved state-of-the-art on ABIDE datasets.
