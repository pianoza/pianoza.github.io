#### Now
I am a postdoc at the [Barcelona Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Lab](https://bcn-aim.org/) in the University of Barcelona. Currently working on [EuCanImage](https://eucanimage.eu/) project to build a Cancer Imaging Platform for Artificial Intelligence in Oncology.

#### Education
I hold a PhD degree in Artificial Intelligence and Medical Image Analysis, Master's degree in Computer Vision and Robotics, and Bachelor's degree in Information Systems.

#### Brief
I was born in a little village in the middle of nowhere, called [Abay](https://kk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Абай_(Келес_ауданы)) in the South of Kazakhstan. Growing up in a post-soviet, very Kazakh family of teachers, I spoke three languages Kazakh, Russian, and Uzbek. The last one just happened because we had TV channels randomly picked up from our southern neighbor.

Many exciting and boring things happend until I reached where I am now. Lived in France and UK for some time and I am now living in Spain. Fluent in English and learaning Spanish.

#### Interests and hobbies
I am interested in computer vision, medical imaging, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. These interests lead me to follow a career in academia and research.

Music, drawing, reading, and sim-racing are my hobbies. I play the [dombyra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dombra), a traditional Kazakh folk instrument, and a little bit of guitar. Being colorblind and having a hard time with colors makes me draw only using pencil. I like reding classics when it comes to literature, but recently got into science-fiction and fantasy. I am still waiting for fully autonomous cars to hit the streets, until then I will keep driving in a simulator.
