<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    I am a postdoc at the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine lab at the University of Barcelona.
</p>
<p>
    I do research in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Medical Imaging problems.
    Which means I develop AI algorithms to help doctors to detect terrible deseases faster and more accurately. Which really means that I look at CT, MRI, and X-Ray sort of images a lot. But really? I look at spreadhseets a lot too. And of course, some coding is also involved.</p>
<p>
    Take a look at <a href="/research">this page</a> for more details on what are my research interests and what I am currently working on.
</p>
<p>
    Oh, by the way, questions and comments are welcome in the blog posts!
